# Evolution Strategies for MountainCar


## Running the Code

Install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy torch matplotlib
```


The main script for running the Evolution Strategies experiments is strategies.py.

1.	Ensure all files are in the same directory:
Place policy.py, mountaincar.py, strategies.py, and main.py in the same folder.

2.	Run the main script:
Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the files, and execute:

```
python strategies.py
```

Notes

I used multiprocessing to parallelize the evaluation to improve runtime efficiency.
